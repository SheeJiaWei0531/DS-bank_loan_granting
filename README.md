# Bank loan granting analysis

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis based on the given dataset, visually and statistically summarizing, inspecting, and understanding the main characteristics of the data.

Additionally, it involves analyzing the existing bank loan approval model and proposing improvements to enhance the bank's profit by building another model on top of the original model.

## Challenges

The details of the challenges will be discussed in the notebook. There are two main chanllenges in this project:

1. Understanding the missing data in the dataset.

2. Feature engineering on the dataset.

## Features

The main features and functionalities of this project include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Feature engineering on the dataset.
- Analysis of the existing bank loan approval model.
- Building and evaluating an enhanced model to optimize bank profit.

## Step to run the notebook

1. Restart your kernel
2. Clear all the outputs
3. Run all

Take note that I am using XGBoost for the modelling. If you do not have the package, you may need to install it.
Thank you
